# DockerBuilder (DBD)

### A small Python 3 utility to automate the proccess of building and pushing images to Registries

Why? I'm still to implement CI/CD in my workplace and manually inputting everything every time is tiresome and extremely inefficient.

Once the parameters are set I can only change the tags and rebuild and push.

### Usage

WIP

### Todo
- Add parentheses to the print commands. The script is not working on python3 without them.
- Map the optional parameters
- Improve the documentation


### Installation of the script

- Clone this repo

- ```bash
  chmod +x install.sh
  #Run the installer
  ./install.sh
  ```

After running this command, you'll be able to use the skey command globally.
